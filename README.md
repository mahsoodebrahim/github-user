The purpose of this project was to build an application that allows a user to search for any github user and subsequently presented with information related to that github user. The information includes the number of repositories, followers, gists, and individuals this user is following. Further, the application displays several graphs that gives more insight into the activity of this particular github user; these include most popular languages, repositories, forks, and the greatest number of stars per programming language. The login is handled via the Auth0 API and the maximum number of searches allowed per hour are displayed the top-right hand corner of the application. Once the application is loaded, a user is greated with a login page, however, if the user manually navigates to an unknown url, they are presented with an error page.
